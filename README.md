# Death-Cloud
This datapack is a utilitly datapack that allows moderators to wield a black cloud of death that can be summoned 5 blocks in front of them.
P.S It can kill people in Creative.

# How to use
Simply add all the mods you want to be able to use the cloud to the team: Cloud Certified. Then tell them to use the function: death_cloud:cloud_toggle to activate the cloud.
Simply pass the Area Effect Cloud through a person and poof! They are dead. If at any time you want to revoke permissions for the Cloud, simply remove the person you want to revoke permissions from the Cloud Certified team.
